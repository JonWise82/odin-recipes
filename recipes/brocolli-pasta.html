    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the pasta</li>
        <li>You can begin this step while the shells are cooking. First, 
            heat the olive oil and butter over medium-high heat in a 
            large skillet. Then once the butter has melted add the onion 
            and cook it for about 3 minutes until it’s soft and translucent. 
            Now, add the minced garlic and cook it for just 30 seconds until 
            it’s aromatic.
        </li>
        <li>Next, you’ll need to cook the broccoli before you can make 
            the sauce. Add the florets to the skillet along with the 
            Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper. 
            Then stir everything together and cook the broccoli for 
            5 minutes or until it softens up a bit.
        </li>
        <li>After the broccoli is cooked, pour the heavy cream into 
            the skillet along with 1⁄2 cup of the reserved pasta 
            water. Then bring the mixture to a boil. Now, turn the 
            heat down to a simmer and let it cook for 5 minutes or 
            until the sauce thickens. Finally, add the parmesan 
            cheese and cooked shells to the broccoli mixture and 
            toss everything together. Then cook for one more minute 
            to meld all the flavors.
        </li>
        <li>Once the shells are fully coated in sauce and the dish 
            is complete, transfer the creamy broccoli pasta to your 
            serving dish of choice. Then garnish it with some more 
            freshly grated parmesan cheese and serve with some of my
             yummy Garlic Bread if you like.
        </li>
    </ol>
