    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>140g butter, softened, plus extra for the tin</li>
        <li>140g castersugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>140g self raising flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>2 very ripe bananas, mashed</li>
        <li>50g icing sugar</li>
        <li>Handful dried banana chips, for decoration</li>
    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.</li>
        <li>Butter a 2lb loaf tin and line the base and sides with 
            baking parchment.</li>
        <li>Cream 140g softened butter and 140g caster sugar until 
            light and fluffy, then slowly add 2 beaten large eggs 
            with a little of the 140g flour.</li>
        <li>Fold in the remaining flour, 1 tsp baking powder and 
            2 mashed bananas.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for about 
            50 mins, or until cooked through. Check the loaf at 5-min 
            intervals from around 30-40 mins in the oven by testing it 
            with a skewer (it should be able to be inserted and 
            removed cleanly), as the time may vary depending on the 
            shape of your loaf tin.</li>
        <li>Cool in the tin for 10 mins, then remove to a wire rack.</li>
        <li>Mix 50g icing sugar with 2-3 tsp water to make a runny icing.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the icing across the top of the cake and decorate with 
            a handful of banana chips.</li>
    </ul>
